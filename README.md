  A USB cable for connecting the board to your computer.
  Development environment (e.g., STM32CubeIDE or PlatformIO).

### Tasks:

  Set up the development environment and create a new project for your STM32 board.
  Configure the GPIO pin connected to an LED as an output.
  Write a C program to toggle the LED on and off with a delay to create a blinking effect.
  Build and flash the program to your microcontroller.
  Observe the LED blinking on your board.

## Project 2: Button-Controlled LED

### Objective:

  To create an embedded program that controls an LED's state using a push button.

### Requirements:

  An STM32 development board (or your preferred microcontroller).
  An LED and a current-limiting resistor.
  A push-button switch.
  Appropriate connections.
  Development environment.

### Tasks:
